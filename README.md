# object-detection
<<<<<<< task1-2
## Overview
* This project Involve leveraging data scraped from web platforms and Telegram channels, the project aims to centralize disparate data into a comprehensive and scalable data warehouse. Additionally, object detection capabilities powered by YOLO (You Only Look Once) will be integrated to extract visual insights, further enriching the data analysis process.

* The implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) frameworks forms the backbone of this initiative, ensuring seamless data collection, cleaning, and transformation. This approach not only ensures data integrity but also allows for efficient querying and reporting, facilitating the identification of trends, patterns, and correlations.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable data warehouse that consolidates data on Ethiopian medical businesses, enabling advanced analytics and reporting. The specific goals include:
1.	Developing a Data Scraping and Collection Pipeline: Automate the extraction of data from web sources and Telegram channels to ensure comprehensive coverage of Ethiopian medical businesses.
2.	Establishing Data Cleaning and Transformation Pipelines: Create processes to clean, standardize, and transform raw data into formats suitable for analysis.
3.	Integrating Object Detection Using YOLO: Enhance the analytical capabilities by detecting and categorizing objects from visual data sources.
4.	Designing and Implementing a Data Warehouse: Develop a centralized, scalable repository to store and manage the collected and processed data.
5.	Data Integration and Enrichment: Combine multiple data sources, enrich them with additional context, and prepare them for analytical use.
